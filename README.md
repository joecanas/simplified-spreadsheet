# Simplified JavaScript Spreadsheet

Create a simplified 5x5 spreadsheet using JS, HTML and CSS. (See separate animated GIF showing the expected behavior.)

## Rules:

Feel free to use frameworks such as Vue.js, React or Angular.

Do not use a spreadsheet library such as Hansontable.

Each cell can contain a number or a blank string. Numbers automatically get tallied up and rendered as the sum, avg, min or max below the column. Strings are ignored in the tally.

Clicking on the tally should change the column type as follows:

- SUM => AVG
- AVG => MIN
- MIN => MAX
- MAX => SUM

Negative numbers should be accounted for.

Don’t worry about cases where inputs contain anything other than a number or a blank string such as “Hello World”.

Bonuses:

- Make the number of rows and columns configurable.
- Iterations on the spreadsheet style, UX or functionality.
